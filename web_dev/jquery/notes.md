Release O

jQuery Game Plan:

- Find 5 jQuery cheat sheets (bookmark top two)
- Search/Review jQuery examples on Stack Overflow, W3schools, etc
- Examine jQuery docs
- Watch a four jQuery youtube videos

Release 1

I think out of all the strategies, going through an indepth review of jQuery with the official jQuery API docs, served to be the most successful. 

I also think that watching videos of people creating their own examples of jQuery worked best. I'm definitely more of a visual learner!
