	<p>There are certain memories that remain vivid from my childhood. Growing up in Chicago, my older sister, Carmen,  would drive me to school. Like any good older sibling, she never let me make any decisions. And so, for years of my I was stuck in the backseat of her car listening to her music.</p>
	<p>In the 90's there was a select rotation of music that bellowed out of the speakers on our way to school. Station after station, my ears met and befriended Seattle grundge. Yesterday, one of the voices that narrated my car rides to school growing up, lost his battle with drugs. <strong>Chris Cornell, Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman, died at 52.</strong></p>
	<p>As I replay his hits and discover some new gems, I become thankful for all the great music my sister forced me to listen to. As I read through all the celebrity tributes, there is one quote that was wonderful to read. 		
	</p>
	<p>In an article for Metro UK, Alice Cooper is quoted as saying <em>"Chris Cornell, in our circle, was known as "The Voice" because he has the best voice in rock and roll. Black Hole Sun will live on as a classic, and is a true legacy of rock and roll".</em> Chris Cornell was most notable for having an unparalleled four-octave vocal range (similar to Freddie Mercury, Robert Plant, and Steven Tyler).</p>
