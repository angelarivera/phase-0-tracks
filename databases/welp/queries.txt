You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

	SELECT users.first_name, businesses.name, reviews.comment 
	FROM users
	JOIN businesses ON users.id = businesses.id
	JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id;
		Bradford|Sushi World|GREAT FOOD!
		Angela|Lotus Yoga|it was okay. just kidding.

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

	SELECT users.first_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment 
	FROM users
  	JOIN businesses ON users.id = businesses.id
  	JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id;
		Bradford|Sushi World|5|GREAT FOOD!
		Angela|Lotus Yoga|4|it was okay. just kidding.


How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

	SELECT users.first_name, reviews.stars, businesses.name
   	FROM reviews
	JOIN users ON reviews.user_id=users.id
  	JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id=businesses.id
   	WHERE businesses.name="Lotus Yoga";
		Angela|4|Lotus Yoga
		Tyler|5|Lotus Yoga

	SELECT * 
	FROM users, businesses, reviews 
	WHERE businesses.name="Lotus Yoga";
