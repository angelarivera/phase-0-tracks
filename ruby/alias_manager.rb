# Write a program that takes a real name and creates a fake name

# Puts Ask for first name
# first_name = gets.chomp

# Ask for last name

# Select first name, convert the string to lowercase letters
# Select lower case first name, convert the string to an array


# Iterate through the array 

# def vowelchanger (full name)
# vowels = [a,e,i,o,u]
# for each letter in the name
# see if its a vowel
# if it is then what is the index of the vowel
# and set that vowel to the following +1 item index 
# if the letter in the full namer variable is "u" 
# then program the computer to automatically go to the letter a 
# return value will be changed name (with vowels changed)
# set that return value to a new variable 


# def consonantchanger (full name)
# get result from new name from vowel changer
# consants = [b,c,f,l]
# return value will be changed name 

# new first name


#    If an item in the first name array has the letters "a,e,i,o, u" take the index that vowel is in and change it to the following vowel. (Example: a -> e) 
#    Create an alphabet variable that has "a-z" to reference.
#    If an item in the first name array has a consonant take the index of that consonant and change it to the letter that follows it in the alphabet
# Place both of these changes in an empty array (.map)? Or .map!?












# Select last name, convert the string to lowercase letters
# Select lower case last name, convert the string to an array

# Iterate through the array, 
#    If an item in the last name array has the letters "a,e,i,o, u" take the index that vowel is in and change it to the following vowel. (Example: a -> e) 
#    Create an alphabet variable that has "a-z" to reference.
#    If an item in the last name array has a consonant take the index of that consonant and change it to the letter that follows it in the alphabet
# Place both of these changes in an empty array (.map)? Or .map!?

# one method per step, insdie that method you can be focused on that one thing you have to do!
