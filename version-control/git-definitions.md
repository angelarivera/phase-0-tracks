# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the process of keeping your work (software) organized! It's useful because it keeps track of your files over periods of time. You can also collaborate with other developers using it. Another reason its useful is because you can review previous versions of work. And most importantly, you always have backup!

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is what you make when you want to have a copy of an existing project to work on. It's best to branch off a master so that you can work separately. It's really useful to branch because that way you can have a safe space to make errors and experiment on. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is something you do after you stage a file. Once you have updated a file and it is ready to be submitted, you can commit it (incorporate into) and add a coherent and valuable message. 

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is an issue that happens when your feature branch and the master branch you want to merge with are not in sync. 

Thanks for reviewing my work, Glenna!
